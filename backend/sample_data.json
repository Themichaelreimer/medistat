Originally, the term was created to distinguish physical (termed \"organic\") causes of mental impairment from psychiatric (termed \"functional\") disorders, but during the era when this distinction was drawn, not enough was known about brain science (including neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and mind-brain correlation) for this cause-based classification to be more than educated guesswork labeled with misplaced certainty, which is why it has been deemphasized in current medicine. While mental or behavioural abnormalities related to the dysfunction can be permanent,[4] treating the disease early may prevent permanent damage in addition to fully restoring mental functions.

Galactokinase deficiency is one of the three inborn errors of metabolism that lead to hypergalactosemia.  The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Unlike classic galactosemia, which is caused by deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, galactokinase deficiency does not present with severe manifestations in early infancy. Its major clinical symptom is the development of cataracts during the first weeks or months of life, as a result of the accumulation, in the lens, of galactitol, a product of an alternative route of galactose utilization. The development of early cataracts in homozygous affected infants is fully preventable through early diagnosis and treatment with a galactose-restricted diet. Some studies have suggested that, depending on milk consumption later in life, heterozygous carriers of galactokinase deficiency may be prone to presenile cataracts at 20\u201350 years of age.[3]\n",

The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body.[1] There are multiple forms of alternating hemiplegia, Weber's syndrome, middle alternating hemiplegia, and inferior alternating hemiplegia.  This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.  The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis.  With a lesion in the brainstem, this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem.  The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion.  Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor), VI (Abducens), and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract, the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord.  Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days, many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of alternating hemiplegia are mental impairment, gait and balance difficulties, excessive sweating and changes in body temperature.[1]\n",

It may occur as a single event or subsequent bouts may cause further spread. It is most common in males.[2]:829 It is named after Jay Frank Schamberg, who described it in 1901. There is no known cure for this disease but it is not a life-threatening condition and is mainly of cosmetic concern, although, because it can appear so suddenly, so extensively and because it usually leaves permanent discoloration of the skin, it can cause understandable psychological concern. The skin lesions sometimes cause itching, which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg's disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed, some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance.

This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e, while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously.  This differs from the very common condition of \"land sickness\" that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours.

The adult Loa loa filarial worm migrates throughout the subcutaneous tissues of humans, occasionally crossing into subconjunctival tissues of the eye where it can be easily observed. Loa loa does not normally affect one's vision but can be painful when moving about the eyeball or across the bridge of the nose.[2][3] The disease can cause red itchy swellings below the skin called \"Calabar swellings\". The disease is treated with the drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and when appropriate, surgical methods may be employed to remove adult worms from the conjunctiva. Loiasis belongs to the so-called neglected diseases.[4]\n",

More specifically, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosterically inhibits fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, but activates phosphofructokinase-I. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is involved in many different metabolic pathways and found in most organisms. FBPase requires metal ions for catalysis (Mg2+ and Mn2+ being preferred) and the enzyme is potently inhibited by Li+.\n",

As with other types of aphasia, the symptoms that accompany PPA depend on what parts of the left hemisphere are significantly damaged. However, unlike most other aphasias, PPA results from continuous deterioration in brain tissue, which leads to early symptoms being far less detrimental than later symptoms. Those with PPA slowly lose the ability to speak, write, read, and generally comprehend language. Eventually, almost every patient becomes mute and completely loses the ability to understand both written and spoken language.[1] Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact,[1] it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer from impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss of executive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.\u2011Marsel Mesulam in 1982.[2] Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum of disorders and Alzheimer's disease. However, PPA is not considered synonymous to Alzheimer's disease due to the fact that, unlike those affected by Alzheimer's disease, those with PPA are generally able to maintain the ability to care for themselves, remain employed, and pursue interests and hobbies. Moreover, in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive deterioration of comprehension and production of language is just one of the many possible types of mental deterioration, such as the progressive decline of memory, motor skills, reasoning, awareness, and visuospatial skills.[1]\n",

Tumors most commonly affect long bones about the knee and in the forearm.[1][3] Additionally, flat bones such as the pelvis and scapula (shoulder blade) may be affected.[5] Hereditary multiple exostoses usually present during childhood. Yet, the vast majority of affected individuals become clinically manifest by the time they reach adolescence.[3][6] Osteochondromas occur in 3% of the general population and represent 35% of all benign tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. The majority of these tumors are solitary non-hereditary lesions and approximately 15% of osteochondromas occur as hereditary multiple exostoses preferably known as hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMOs).[4][7] Osteochondromas do not result from injury and the exact cause remains unknown. Recent research has indicated that multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease.[8]\nThe treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements.[4][7] In hereditary multiple exostoses the indications of surgery are based upon multiple factors that are taken collectively, namely: patient's age, tumor location and number, accompanying symptomatology, esthetic concerns, family history and underlying gene mutation.[1][3] A variety of surgical procedures have been employed to remedy hereditary multiple exostoses such as osteochondroma excision, bone lengthening, corrective osteotomy and hemiepiphysiodesis. Sometimes a combination of the previous procedures is used.[3] The indicators of surgical success in regard to disease and patient characteristics are greatly disputable.[3] Because most studies of hereditary multiple exostoses are retrospective and of limited sample size with missing data, the best evidence for each of the currently practiced surgical procedures is lacking.[3]\n",

The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost.  The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the work of Hugo Liepmann,  Adolph Kussmaul,  Arnold Pick,  Paul Flechsig, Hermann Munk, Carl Nothnagel, Theodor Meynert,  and linguist Heymann Steinthal, among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as \"ideo-kinetic apraxia\" by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution.[1] The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought to be related to the areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the left parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.\n",

Normally, Schwann cells function beneficially to protect and speed along balance and sound information to the brain. At times, however, things go awry. For reasons still under investigation, a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, NF2, located on chromosome 22, results in abnormal production of the cell protein named Merlin, and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumor. The tumor originates mostly on the vestibular division of the nerve rather than the cochlear division, but hearing as well as balance will be affected  as the tumor enlarges. The great majority of these VS (95%) are unilateral, in one ear only. They are called \"sporadic\" (i.e., by-chance, non-hereditary). Although non-cancerous, they can do harm or even become life-threatening if they grow to press on other cranial nerves and vital structures such as the brain stem. Variations in the mutation determine the nature of the tumor's development. The only environmental exposure that has been definitely associated with the growth of a VS is radiation exposure to the head. [3]\n",

Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic disorders.[2]\nThe term inborn errors of metabolism was coined by a British physician, Archibald Garrod (1857\u20131936), in 1908. He is known for work that prefigured the \"one gene-one enzyme\" hypothesis, based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria.

The law states that subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more memories that happened further from the incident.[2] The type of information that is forgotten can range from a specific memory, such as a single event, or a more general memory.

Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.[citation needed]\n",

Proper activation or deactivation of these neurons is an integral component for proper movement. If something causes too much basal ganglia output, then the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamocortical projection neurons become too inhibited, and one cannot initiate voluntary movement. These disorders are known as hypokinetic disorders. However, a disorder leading to abnormally low output of the basal ganglia leads to reduced inhibition, and thus excitation, of the thalamocortical projection neurons (VA and VL) which synapse onto the cortex.

There are three types of FCD with subtypes, including type 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, each with distinct histopathological features.[3][2] All forms of focal cortical dysplasia lead to disorganization of the normal structure of the cerebral cortex. Type 1 FCD exhibits subtle alterations in cortical lamination. Type 2a FCD exhibits neurons that are larger than normal that are called dysmorphic  neurons (DN). FCD type 2b exhibits complete loss of laminar structure, and the presence of DN and enlarged cells are called balloon cells (BC) for their large elliptical cell body shape, laterally displaced nucleus, and lack of dendrites or axons. The developmental origin of balloon cells is currently believed to be derived from neuronal or glial progenitor cells.  Balloon cells are similar in structure to giant cells in the disorder tuberous sclerosis complex.[citation needed] Type 3 FCDs are cortical disorganisation associated with other lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis (type 3a), long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (3b), vascular malformations (3c) or scar/hypoxic damages (3d).[1][2]\n",

Marek's disease is caused by an alphaherpesvirus known as 'Marek's disease virus' (MDV) or Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2).[2]  The disease is characterized by the presence of T cell lymphoma as well as infiltration of nerves and organs by lymphocytes.[3]  Viruses related to MDV appear to be benign and can be used as vaccine strains to prevent Marek's disease.  For example, the related Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT), causes no apparent disease in turkeys and continues to be used as a vaccine strain for prevention of Marek's disease (see below).  Birds infected with GaHV-2 can be carriers and shedders of the virus for life.  Newborn chicks are protected by maternal antibodies for a few weeks.  After infection, microscopic lesions are present after one to two weeks, and gross lesions are present after three to four weeks.  The virus is spread in dander from feather follicles and transmitted by inhalation.[4]\n",

It is an autosomal dominant inheritance and is variable in its expressivity.[6] Haploinsufficiency in the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene (11q13) has been reported in patients with otodental syndrome and is thought to cause the phenotype.[2] Both males and females are equally affected.

These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age.[2] Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bone sarcomas that necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm. Cases in patients with Ollier disease has shown a link to IDH1, IDH2, and PTH1R gene mutations. Currently, there are no forms of treatment for the underlying condition of Ollier disease but complications such as fractures, deformities, malignancies that arise from it can be treated through surgical procedures.

This will ultimately lead to affected development of tissues and organs throughout the body. In addition to the physical abnormalities, leprechaunism is also characterized by endocrine system abnormalities that can lead to conditions such as hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels), hyperinsulemia (high blood insulin levels), and the enlargement of certain sex organs such as the penis in males, and the clitoris in females.\n",

It exhibits an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.[2][3][4] The first confirmed case was diagnosed in 1865 by French doctor Trousseau. Later in 1889, the German doctor von Recklinghausen indicated that the liver contains iron, and due to bleeding being considered to be the cause, he called the pigment \"Haemochromatosis.\" [5] In 1935, English doctor Sheldon's groundbreaking book titled, Haemochromatosis, reviewed 311 patient case reports and presented the idea that haemochromatosis was a congenital metabolic disorder.[5] Hereditary haemochromatosis is a congenital disorder which affects the regulation of iron metabolism thus causing increased gut absorption of iron and a gradual build-up of pathologic iron deposits in the liver and other internal organs, joint capsules and the skin.[5] The iron overload could potentially cause serious disease from the age of 40\u201350 years. In the final stages of the disease, the major symptoms include liver cirrhosis, diabetes and bronze-colored skin. There are four types of hereditary hemochromatosis which are classified depending on the age of onset and other factors such as genetic cause and mode of inheritance.[6]\n",

Weakness may be mild and limited to certain muscle groups, or more severe full-body paralysis. During an attack, reflexes may be decreased or absent.

The cause of this disease is a mutation in the DLX3 (distal-less 3) gene, which controls hair follicle differentiation and induction of bone formation. One-hundred percent of patients with TDO suffer from two co-existing conditions called enamel hypoplasia and taurodontism in which the abnormal growth patterns of the teeth result in severe external and internal defects.[1] The hair defects are characterized as being rough, course, with profuse shedding. Hair is curly and kinky at infancy but later straightens. Dental defects are characterized by dark-yellow/brownish colored teeth, thin and/or possibly pitted enamel, that is malformed. The teeth can also look normal in color, but also have a physical impression of extreme fragility and thinness in appearance. Additionally, severe underbites where the top and bottom teeth fail to correctly align may be present; it is common for the affected individual to have a larger, more pronounced lower jaw and longer bones. The physical deformities that TDO causes become more noticeable with age, and emotional support for the family as well as the affected individual is frequently recommended. Adequate treatment for TDO is a team based approach,  mostly involving physical therapists, dentists, and oromaxillofacial surgeons. Genetic counseling is also recommended.\n",

As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells,[2] which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria.[3] XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births[4] and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000[5] male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody.  Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.[3]\n",

DD-1 has been further divided into 4 different subtypes (DD-1a,1b,1c,1d) based on the radiographic features.[2]\n",

Other reported clinical features include difficulty in swallowing, oculogyric crises, somnolence, irritability, hyperthermia, and seizures. Chorea, athetosis, hypersalivation, rash with eczema, and sudden death have also been reported. Patients with mild phenotypes may deteriorate if given folate antagonists such as methotrexate, which can interfere with a salvage pathway through which dihydrobiopterin is converted into tetrahydrobiopterin via dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment options include substitution with neurotransmitter precursors (levodopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tetrahydrobiopterin.[3] Response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).[4]\n",

A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7 mmol/l (100\u2013126 mg/dl) (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered slightly hyperglycemic, and above 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) is generally held to have diabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too hyperglycemic can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person's renal threshold of glucose and overall glucose tolerance. On average, however, chronic levels above 10\u201312\u00a0mmol/L (180\u2013216\u00a0mg/dl) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.\n",

People with this condition present a very distinct facial appearance with flattened cheek bones, flat and broad tip nose, shortened distance between the nose and upper lip, triangular-shaped mouth with tick lips and strabismus. It is also characterized by a patent ductus arteriosus, which is the failure to close the ductus that connects the aorta and pulmonary artery during pre-birth life and may cause many symptoms including breathing issues and heart failure. Abnormalities of hand and finger development have also been reported in people with this condition, including short or absent fifth finger. Other abnormal findings include supernumerary nipples.[7] These conditions often affect multiple members of a family and there are no reports of non-genetic factors that might be related with incidence of this syndrome.

Firstly, NMDA receptor antagonist are physician-prescribed drugs for therapeutic treatment of human diseases such as memantine for Alzheimer's disease and amantadine for Parkinson's disease, and also occur as street drugs that are taken recreationally. Secondly in the field of anesthesiology, the dissociative anesthesia of many general anesthetics is due to NMDA receptor antagonist properties. Because the neuronal vacuolation of Olney's lesions evolves into neuronal necrosis or death of neurons, it is important to determine whether Olney's lesions occur in humans, not only in experimental animals. The essential question is whether an NMDA receptor antagonist drug is to be considered a human neurotoxin or not.

However, the exact gene(s) involved has not yet been identified.[1] It can occur in the absence of clinical features of Marfan syndrome and of systemic hypertension.[2][3][4][5][6] Over time this weakness, along with systolic pressure, results in a tear in the aortic intima layer thus allowing blood to enter between the layers of tissue and cause further tearing. Eventually complete rupture of the aorta occurs and the pleural cavity fills with blood. Warning signs include chest pain, ischemia, and hemorrhaging in the chest cavity. This condition, unless found and treated early, usually results in death. Immediate surgery is the best treatment in most cases.[7] FAD is not to be confused with PAU (penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers) and IMH (intramural hematoma), both of which present in ways similar to that of familial aortic dissection.[8]\n",

Although typically perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy,[3] it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.[4]\n",

In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by micromelia (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited.

In an unaffected individual, this isozyme inactivates circulating cortisol to the less active metabolite cortisone. The inactivating mutation leads to elevated local concentrations of cortisol in the aldosterone sensitive tissues like the kidney. Cortisol at high concentrations can cross-react and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor due to the non-selectivity of the receptor, leading to aldosterone-like effects in the kidney. This is what causes the hypokalemia, hypertension, and hypernatremia associated with the syndrome. Patients often present with severe hypertension and end-organ changes associated with it like left ventricular hypertrophy, retinal, renal and neurological vascular changes along with growth retardation and failure to thrive.

Winchester syndrome was once considered to be related to a similar condition, multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA).[3] However, it was discovered that the two are caused by mutations found in different genes; they are now thought of as two separate disorders. Appearances resemble rheumatoid arthritis. Increased uronic acid is demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts from the skin and to a lesser degree in both parents. Despite initial tests not showing increased mucopolysaccharide excretion, the disease was regarded as a mucopolysaccharidosis.[2] Winchester syndrome is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n",

It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage, but in interstitial lung disease, the repair process is disrupted, and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The disease presents itself with the following symptoms: shortness of breath, nonproductive coughing, fatigue, and weight loss, which tend to develop slowly, over several months. The average rate of survival for someone with this disease is between three and five years.[5] The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.\n",

Weight stigma is similar and has been broadly defined as bias or discriminatory behaviors targeted at individuals because of their weight.[1][2] Such social stigmas can span one's entire life, as long as excess weight is present, starting from a young age and lasting into adulthood.[3] Several studies from across the world (e.g., United States, University of Marburg, University of Leipzig) indicate overweight and obese individuals experience higher levels of stigma relative to their thinner counterparts. In addition, they marry less often, experience fewer educational and career opportunities, and on average earn a lesser income than normal weight individuals.[3] Although public support regarding disability services, civil rights and anti-workplace discrimination laws for obese individuals have gained support across the years,[3] overweight and obese individuals still experience discrimination, which may have detrimental implications to physiological and psychological health. These issues are compounded with the significant negative physiological effects associated with obesity.[4]\n",
